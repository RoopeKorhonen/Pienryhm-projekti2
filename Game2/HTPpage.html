    <h1>How to play</h1>
    <p>The point of the game is to fly to as many places as you can. By making a successful flight, you will be awarded some points.</p>
    <p>During the game, you might get quicktime events during the flight, so be aware! You will get a penalty, if your answer takes too long.</p>
    <p>The game ends once your co2 runs out.</p>
